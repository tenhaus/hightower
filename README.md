# Hightower

The project aims to make an open source, multi-language, local development environment that prioritizes role-based startup, service dependencies, testing and config generation while remaining useable and unopinionated.

## TODO

- [ ] Load a skaffold environment
- [ ] Watch files for changes and reload
